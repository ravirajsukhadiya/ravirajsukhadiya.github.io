Hi, I am a Ph.D. student at Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.iitgn.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in){:target="\_blank"}. My Doctoral Advisor is [Prof. Mayank Singh](https://mayank4490.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} and my research interests are in Natural Language Processing and I also would like to do get exposed to Information Security. Currently I am exploring vast area of Natural Language Processing. I like to work on social media texts and historical literature mostly in context to India. Currently I am working on code-mixing/switching texts.

 Before joining Ph.D., I was working on Project Gandhipedia as Junior Research Fellow at [Lingo-Labs](https://labs.iitgn.ac.in/lingo/){:target="\_blank"} at IIT Gandginagar. Previously I did my Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from [School of Computing and Information Sciences](https://scis.uohyd.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} at [University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} and Bachelors in Information Technology from [Government College of Engineering, Amravati](https://gcoea.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}.

  Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

  Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

  Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
